Replica_IO is a framework for composing practical distributed
replication mechanisms.

## Status üå±

This project is in its early stages. It's being developed entirely in
the open from day one. So more stuff will follow. Stay tuned! üëÄ

## Purpose üåü

The purpose of this project is to advance computing by making highly
reliable distributed systems more practical to implement.

More and more we depend on increasingly complex computing systems.
Therefore, we ought to make such critical systems highly reliable.
Distributed systems are potentially much more reliable than
centralized ones. However, anyone who tried implementing
fault-tolerant distributed systems knows how hard it is in practice.

Practical solutions should be both efficient and easy to use.
Unfortunately, distributed systems tend to be less efficient, and they
are notoriously complex. Often we can tolerate moderate decrease in
efficiency, but reliability is crucial for critical systems we largely
depend upon.

Nevertheless, complex problems can have neat solutions that are not
only efficient, but also easy to properly apply in practice.
Discovering and developing those solutions obviously requires
significant effort. This project is making such effort.
